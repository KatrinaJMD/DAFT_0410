But we have two *type* fields (`Type 1` and `Type 2`) that have string values. In data analysis, string fields have to be transformed to numerical format in order to be analyzed. \n",

        "Let's address the first question first. You can use a method called **One Hot Encoding** which is frequently used in machine learning to encode categorical string variables to numerical. The idea is to gather all the possible string values in a categorical field and create a numerical field for each unique string value. Each of those numerical fields uses `1` and `0` to indicate whether the data record has the corresponding categorical value. A detailed explanation of One Hot Encoding can be found in [this article](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f). You will formally learn it in Module 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if a pokemon has `Type 1` as `Poison` and `Type 2` as `Fire`, then its `Poison` and `Fire` fields are `1` whereas all other fields are `0`. If a pokemon has `Type 1` as `Water` and `Type 2` as `NaN`, then its `Water` field is `1` whereas all other fields are `0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In the next cell, use One Hot Encoding to encode `Type 1` and `Type 2`. Use the pokemon type values as the names of the numerical fields you create.\n",
        "\n",

        "It's possible that the game mechanics are designed in such a way,\n",

        "or weaker (having lower \"Total\" values) than others.\n",

        "This could be intentional to maintain game balance,\n",
        "or it could be an unintended consequence of the game's design.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS:\n",
        "Some Pokémon types might be more likely to have higher \"Total\" values,\n",
        "because they typically evolve from weaker forms,\n",
        "while others might have lower \"Total\" values,\n",
        "because they do not evolve or have fewer evolutionary stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "This could be an interesting pattern to explore further.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. POPULARITY OR RARITY:\n",
        "Certain Pokémon types might be more popular or rare,\n",
        "leading game designers to assign them higher \"Total\" values,\n",
        "to make them more appealing or valuable to players.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, less popular or more common types might be assigned lower \"Total\" values,\n",
        "to make them less desirable or easier to acquire.\n",
        "\n",
        "4; CONFOUNDING FATCORS:\n",
        "It's also possible that there are other variables in the dataset,\n",
        "that influence both the Pokémon type and the \"Total\" value, creating a correlation between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, further investigation would be needed to identify and account for these factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "While these theories can be informed by the correlations found in the dataset,\n",
        "it's important to conduct additional research, collect more data,\n",

            "Certain Pokémon types might be more popular or rare,\n",
            "leading game designers to assign them higher \"Total\" values,\n",
            "to make them more appealing or valuable to players.\n",
            "\n",
